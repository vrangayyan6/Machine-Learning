I recommend giving Five Night's at Freddy's a try. It has simple mechanics and there jumpscares are not even scary in my opinion, there just bobbing heads. But it's backstory is very dark. Also for parents, there is this dude named golden Freddy. You can get by his jumpscare by selecting on custom night: 1987. You will see his black deep eyes following with a lower pitch version of the jumpscare sound, he also makes your game ded.    0.0\n",

Graphics and sound are excellent in MOST scenes. Could have a little more ability to go your own way. However there is more than enough possibilities to entertain. Only wish it was longer. End comes too quickly. All in all an excellent game.    0.0\n",
              "      19000  I am an avid fan of this game and have been in the lore since the first game. Something I need to address is all of the parents who are hating on the game just because they dont like it or they only watched the theories and the backstories.\\nIs the game suspenseful? Yes, 100%. Does the game itself show any violence or gore? No. Only the theories and the backstory to why the events happen in the game are disturbing, but extremely intriguing. The only blood that is shown in the game franchise is at the very end of the third game when you see a purple man go inside a spring-lock suit, and pro...    0.0\n",
